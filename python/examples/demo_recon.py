Description

Reconstructs the geographical coordinates of the buses
from a subset of measurments.

Used to construct a oneline!

])

GRAPHS IN LIBRARY WITH PROBLEMS
- They are either not fully connected
- or there are some zero values/massive values.
- causes big issues in the convolutions

PROBLEMATIC:
- LENGTH, WECC

WORKING:
- IMPEDANCE, WECC
